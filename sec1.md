## Identify the benefits and considerations of using Cloud Services
### identify the benefits of cloud computing, such as High Availability, Scalability, Elasticity, Agility, and Disaster Recovery 
### identify the differences between Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx) 
### Describe the Consumption-Based Model 

## Describe the Differences between categories of cloud services
### describe the shared responsibility model
### describe Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS),
### describe Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
### describe serverless computing
### describe Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
### identify a service type based on a use case


## Describe the Differences between types of Cloud Computing
### define cloud computing
**Cloud Computing:** the process of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data rather than a local server or a personal computer.

### describe public cloud 
**Public Cloud:** Everything is built on the Cloud Provider aka “Cloud Native
**Benefits:** it’s the most cost-effective. There are security Controls by default but it might not meet security requirements. The Level of Configuration is limited based on what the cloud service provider exposes to you. You don’t need in-depth knowledge of underlying infrastructure 

#### describe private cloud 
**Private Cloud:**  Everything built on company’s data centers aka On-Premise
**Benefits:** The cloud could be OpenStack. It is the most expensive type of cloud computing. There is no guarantee its secure however it can meet any security compliance requirement if you put in the work. You can configure the infrastructure however you like. You need to know in-depth knowledge and how to configure all levels of your infrastructure 

#### describe hybrid cloud 
**Hybrid Cloud:** is using both On-Premise services and a Cloud Service** Provider. 
**Benefits:** It could be more cost-effective based on what you offload to the cloud. You have to secure your connection to the cloud which gives you the ability to meet all security requirements. You need to have in-depth knowledge and know how to configure all levels of your infrastructure and know the CSPs services.
