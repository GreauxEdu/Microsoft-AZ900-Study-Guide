# Describe Cloud Concepts (20-25%)
## Identify the benefits and considerations of using Cloud Services
### identify the benefits of cloud computing, such as High Availability, Scalability, Elasticity, Agility, and Disaster Recovery 
* **General Benefits:** Some general benefits for cloud computing include cost savings (both real and accounting), possibility of increased security, global reach (ability to deploy applications around the world which increases speed and performance for global users), range of on-demand services (VMs, AI, Machine Learning, Windows/Linux Servers, Databases, etc.), and a range of tools users have access to.

* **Cost Savings:** Generally speaking, Microsoft can buy, build, and maintain a server on a dollars-per-our basis at a cheaper basis. Users can take steps to reduce costs like turning off services when they aren't in use and adjusting service amounts based on demand.

* **High Availability:** the cloud in general has higher availability than the servers you're running. Availaibility is expressed as a percentage, it's the ability of a system to respond to users. Microsoft Azure has a 99.99% availability (four nines, 4 minutes per month of downtime).

* **Scalability:** is the ability to handle growth of users or demand. Allows end-users to add capacity for their resources.

* **Elasticity:** is the ability of a system to automatically grow and shrink based on application demand and automating it. 

* **Agility:** users have the ability to rapidly respond to market or environment needs in real time based on demand. Gives you the ability to detect when traffic is higher and then be able to grow the system. 

* **Disaster Recovery:** is the ability of a system to recover from failure within a period of time and how much data is lost. End-users are able to get a duplicate copy of their environment.

### identify the differences between Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx) 
* **Capital Expenditure (CapEx):** is money invested in assets (like computers) that return investment overtime. This could lead to tax advantages and write-offs. Can be seen as the upfront money invested in typical on premises data servers.
* **Operational Expenditure (OpEx):** is money spent on every day operating expenses. 

### Describe the Consumption-Based Model 
* The **Consumption-Based Model** gives end-users the ability to pay by minute, hour, or execution. Cloud computing has a robust set of metrics that charge users based on what they are consiming instead of giving standard fixed-rate packages.

### describe the shared responsibility model
* **shared responsibility model:**

### describe Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
* **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS):** allows users to use Virtual Machines (VMs) like windows and linux for whatever they want. This includes VMs, networking, load balancers, and firewalls.

### describe Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
* **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS):**

### describe serverless computing
* **serverless computing:**

### describe Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
* **describe Software-as-a-Service (SaaS):**

### identify a service type based on a use case
* **service type based on a use case:**


## Describe the Differences between types of Cloud Computing
### define cloud computing
**Cloud Computing:** the process of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data rather than a local server or a personal computer.

### describe public cloud 
**Public Cloud:** Everything is built on the Cloud Provider aka “Cloud Native
**Benefits:** it’s the most cost-effective. There are security Controls by default but it might not meet security requirements. The Level of Configuration is limited based on what the cloud service provider exposes to you. You don’t need in-depth knowledge of underlying infrastructure 

#### describe private cloud 
**Private Cloud:**  Everything built on company’s data centers aka On-Premise
**Benefits:** The cloud could be OpenStack. It is the most expensive type of cloud computing. There is no guarantee its secure however it can meet any security compliance requirement if you put in the work. You can configure the infrastructure however you like. You need to know in-depth knowledge and how to configure all levels of your infrastructure 

#### describe hybrid cloud 
**Hybrid Cloud:** is using both On-Premise services and a Cloud Service** Provider. 
**Benefits:** It could be more cost-effective based on what you offload to the cloud. You have to secure your connection to the cloud which gives you the ability to meet all security requirements. You need to have in-depth knowledge and know how to configure all levels of your infrastructure and know the CSPs services.
